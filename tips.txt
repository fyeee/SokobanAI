1. For the alternative heuristic function, I uses manhattan distance to approximate the total step remaining with modifications.
2. Simply summing up the distance from boxes to storage is not a accurate measure since we need robots to move the boxes.
in the heuristic, I add the shortest distance for each box from its closest robot.
3. There are cases when the boxes are stuck in a conner and cannot move out from the corner, and cases when a box is
push to a wall and cannot be push out from the wall nor find a storage point along the wall. In these cases, the game is
in a deadlock state. A infinite heuristic should be return since its unsolvable.
4 Consider the following case:
#########
#  $$$  #
#   .   #
#       #
#  . .  #
#########
the normal manhattan distance heuristic will match all three box to the first storage point. However, this is far off from
the actual cost, the heuristic underestimate the actual cost. By modifying the heuristic, we first find the box with the
closest distance to a storage, pop out both the box and the storage point from the list and keep doing it until we match
each box with a storage point.
This gives us a more accurate measure, even its not a admissible heuristic.
